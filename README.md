If you want the LinkedList class then select LinkedList.h file and hit the copy button, then go to your file and hit ctr + v

Linked List's variables:
  size = the size of your list

Linked List's functions:
  1.push_back = adds an element to the end of the list
  
  2.push_front = adds an element to the front of the list
  3.insert = adds an element at a given index / position
  4.delete_place = removes an given element from the list(to select an element to delete you give the index of the element)    (automaticly deletes the item from the ram)
  5.repeat_push_back = repeatedly pushes back a value
  6.repeat_push_front = repeatedly pushes front a value
  7.recount_size = if you are paronoid about size being off count you can call this function also returns size
  8.begin = returns a pointer of the first element
  9.end = return a pointer of the last element
  10.foreach = does something for each element
  11.clear = delete's all items
  12.replace_all = replace all element's value to a given value
  13.is_contain = returns if the list contains a certain value

Linked List's supported operations:
  1. [] = returns the value of a given index in the brackets
  2.  == = returns true if two given lists have the same size and same value for the same index
  3.  != = reutrn true if the two given lists have different size or different values for the saem index
